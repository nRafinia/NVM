# Dashboard for Containerized Infrastructure Management

## Work-in-progress

This project is a work-in-progress dashboard for managing containerized infrastructure. The dashboard will provide a centralized view of all containerized resources within an organization, including data centers, clusters, and servers. Users will be able to add Docker servers using API or SSH, and they will be able to view and manage containers.

## Key features

* **Centralized view of all containerized resources:** The dashboard will provide a single pane of glass for viewing all containerized resources within an organization. This will make it easy to track the status of containers, identify potential problems, and make changes to the infrastructure.

    > This feature is essential for organizations that use containerized infrastructure to track the health and performance of their environment.

* **Support for multiple Docker servers:** The dashboard will be able to be used to manage Docker servers from multiple providers. This will make it easy to manage a heterogeneous infrastructure.

    > This feature is important for organizations that use Docker servers from a variety of providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

* **Ability to view and manage containers:** The dashboard will provide a variety of tools for viewing and managing containers. Users will be able to view the status of containers, logs, and metrics. They will also be able to start, stop, restart, and delete containers.

    > This feature is essential for administrators to manage containers in their environment.

## Benefits

* **Increased visibility and control:** A dashboard provides a centralized view of all containerized resources, making it easier to track the status of the infrastructure and identify potential problems.

    > This benefit is highlighted in the "Key features" section of the README.

* **Improved efficiency:** A dashboard can automate tasks such as adding and removing Docker servers and managing containers. This can save time and effort for administrators.

    > This benefit is also highlighted in the "Key features" section of the README.

* **Reduced risk:** A dashboard can help to identify and mitigate security risks. For example, a dashboard can be used to monitor container logs for suspicious activity.

    > This benefit is not explicitly mentioned in the "Key features" section of the README, but it is implied by the mention of the ability to view and manage containers.

## Status

The dashboard is currently in the early stages of development. The core features are being developed, and support for additional Docker providers is planned. The user interface will be improved in the future.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you are interested in helping to develop this dashboard, please contact me.

## License

The dashboard is open source and released under the [license file](/LICENSE.md).

## Next steps

The following tasks are planned for the next few months:

* **Complete the development of the dashboard's core features**
* **Add support for additional Docker providers**
* **Improve the dashboard's user interface**

I am confident that this dashboard will be a valuable asset for organizations that use containerized infrastructure.
